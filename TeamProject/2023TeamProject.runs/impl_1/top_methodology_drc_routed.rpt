2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) key_io[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (key_io[0]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) key_io[1] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (key_io[1]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#3 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) key_io[2] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (key_io[2]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#4 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) key_io[3] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (key_io[3]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell keypad_inst/sclk[31]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) sync_inst/c_h_reg[5]/CLR, sync_inst/c_h_reg[6]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_h_reg[7]/CLR, sync_inst/c_h_reg[8]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_h_reg[9]/CLR, sync_inst/c_v_reg[0]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_v_reg[1]/CLR, sync_inst/c_v_reg[2]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_v_reg[3]/CLR, sync_inst/c_v_reg[4]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_v_reg[5]/CLR, sync_inst/c_v_reg[6]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_v_reg[7]/CLR, sync_inst/c_v_reg[8]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_v_reg[9]/CLR (the first 15 of 92 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
