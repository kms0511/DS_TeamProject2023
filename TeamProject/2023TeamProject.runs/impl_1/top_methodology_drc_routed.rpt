2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) key_io[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (key_io[0]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) key_io[1] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (key_io[1]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#3 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) key_io[2] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (key_io[2]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#4 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) key_io[3] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (key_io[3]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[9]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[1]/CLR, graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[2]/PRE,
graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[3]/PRE, graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[4]/CLR,
graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[5]/CLR, graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[6]/PRE,
graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[7]/PRE, graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[8]/CLR
graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[9]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell keypad_inst/sclk[31]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) sync_inst/c_h_reg[5]/CLR, sync_inst/c_h_reg[6]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_h_reg[7]/CLR, sync_inst/c_h_reg[8]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_h_reg[9]/CLR, sync_inst/c_v_reg[0]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_v_reg[1]/CLR, sync_inst/c_v_reg[2]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_v_reg[3]/CLR, sync_inst/c_v_reg[4]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_v_reg[5]/CLR, sync_inst/c_v_reg[6]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_v_reg[7]/CLR, sync_inst/c_v_reg[8]/CLR,
sync_inst/c_v_reg[9]/CLR (the first 15 of 132 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[6] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[6]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[7] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[7]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[8] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin graph_inst/next_bar_y_reg[8]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#9 Warning
